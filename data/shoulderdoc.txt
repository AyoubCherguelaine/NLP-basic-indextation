In laparoscopic gallbladder surgery, carbon dioxide gas is forced into the 
abdomen to separate the organs and improve visibility and access to the 
gallbladder.  One side-effect of this is to separate the liver from the 
diaphragm, where it is usually supported in part by surface tension.  The 
resulting strain on the tissues attaching the two causes pain that is felt 
in the shoulder (`referred pain').  This can be more severe than the 
pain from the (relatively minor) surgical incisions.

A randomised trial explored using suction to drain out the carbon dioxide 
gas.  Pain in the shoulder, at the incision, and over the abdomen was 
assessed twice daily for three days by a questionnaire.  There was no sign 
of any difference in wound or abdominal pain.  You have data on shoulder 
pain, which has been recoded to a 0-4 scale, where 0 is no pain, and 4 is 
the most severe category reported.  The goal is to assess the 
effectiveness of this intervention.

The variables are

id:  a patient identifier
trt:  1 is post-operative suction, 2 is control
sex: 1 is male, 2 is female
age: in years
pain: 0-4 scale
time: 1 is the first, 6 is the last measurement on each person
